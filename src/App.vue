      <span class="font-semibold">DUMB</span> is a benchmark for evaluating the quality of language models for Dutch NLP
      tasks. The set of tasks is designed to be diverse and challenging, to test the limits of current language models.
      The specific datasets and formats are particularly suitable for fine-tuning encoder models, and applicability for
      large generative models is yet to be determined. Please read the paper for more details.
